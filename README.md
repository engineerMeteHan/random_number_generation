# random_number_generation
The random function is used to find the random number between any two defined numbers. In C programming language, the random function has two inbuilt functions: rand() and srand().

rand() Function:
In C programming language, the rand() function is a library function that generates the random number in the range [0, RAND_MAX]. When we use the rand() function in a program, we need to implement the stdlib.h header file because rand() function is defined in the stdlib.h header life.
Syntax: int rand(void)

The rand() function returns the random integer whose range from 0 to RAMD_MAX is a symbolic constant that defines in stdlib.h header file, whose value is greater but less than 32767 depending on the C libraries
